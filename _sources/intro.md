# PythonProgramming - Exercises

This is a collection of small solved introductory Python exercises
intended for people to learn the language.

**NOTE** 
* The solutions to the exercises are given. The exercise text is however still present (replace `None`/## and alike). Ignore those.
* In some places, `input()` is used. This will throw a `StdinNotImplementedError`.
